						<h2>Collaborative finance network enabling connections between borrowers and lenders increasing efficiency, transparency and value</h2>
						
						<h6><br>Company Overview</h6>
						<p>Afluenta is a technology-enabled marketplace that connects lenders and borrowers through its proprietary, self-designed, secure and user friendly platform. By cutting out traditional financial service providers and middlemen, the company delivers attractive yields to lenders/investors and lower-cost, convenient loans to borrowers. This has a significant impact especially in Latin American countries where financial intermediation has been among the most inefficient in the world, resulting in exorbitant borrowing rates and few attractive alternatives for both investors and borrowers. As one of the first platforms in the region and currently focused on individual borrowers, Afluenta made its market test in the acid Argentinean economy and since then has proven and fine-tuned its business model, credit analysis, client acquisition strategy and technology platform. Afluenta has laid the foundation to expand to a number of strategic countries in Latin America initially Peru and Mexico. Elevar Equity III made an investment in the company in March 2016.</p>

						
						<h6>Community Served</h6><br>
						<p><i>Afluenta impacts mid-low working class communities, improving their lives through accessible and efficient consumer credit loans</i></p>
                        <p>Afluenta’s current focus is on middle to mid-low income individuals, allowing them to access loans to improve their lives. 55% of current borrowers earn an average of US $10,000 per annum, in a country where the average GDP per capita, is over 50% higher. The typical Afluenta customers are either employed in public service, are teachers, are in professional services (accountant, plumbers, etc.), or may be self- employed. Some customers are retirees.<br><br>

The impact on the individual borrowers can be seen in the uses of the loans proceeds: to improve/build their home, pay for auto repairs, consolidate and refinance their loans (incl. credit cards) at lower-cost and invest or start their own business. Other uses of loans include taking care of medical expenses, funding education or funding more aspirational needs (e.g. wedding).<br><br>

Afluenta has the mission and potential to increase financial access and penetration as it develops new products and integrates the proper institutional lender with the right risk/reward profile to attend sub-prime and lower-income, unserved borrowers. It is well positioned to achieve this as an excellent financing alternative, given its cost effective platform that can deliver better priced products.</p>
						
						<h6>Business Model</h6>
						<p><i>Proven, data driven and tested proprietary technology enabled platform, a key competitive advantage</i></p><br>
                        
                       Afluenta’s business model is based on a highly efficient and fully automated client segregated marketplace platform. The model cuts out the traditional intermediaries by removing several links out of today’s banking chain. By using technology that enables scale, transparency and operating leverage, Afluenta connects latent supply with latent demand and adds critical functions in the middle, thus simultaneously unlocking value and creating liquidity for buyers and sellers. Some of these key functions are real time credit assessment, risk scoring and other core services, such as loan servicing, transfers, collections and even a secondary market for lender portfolios. Its technology and processes are aligned with global standards and follow the same steps as other successful lending platforms around the world. All of the processes are automated and completed online, providing a simplified and well received experience for clients and investors. Afluenta is building a reputation based on the quality of the loans offered to lenders in the platform. It also has a Guarantee fund in which all lenders are required to contribute allowing lenders to anticipate the collection of non-performing loans from default borrowers.<br><br>
                        
                        <h6>Entrepreneur</h6>
						<p><i>30+ years’ experience, combining expertise in financial services, internet business and technology</i><br><br>

Alejandro Cosentino, founder and CEO of Afluenta has a 30-year career spanning senior positions as marketing vice president of American Express where he played a key role revamping the company in the Latin American region and as consumer marketing manager of Banco Río where he was responsible for the marketing strategy for relaunching the bank after it was acquired by Banco Santander. He has also worked in the technology sector previously as managing director of internet companies for The Exxel Group and as CEO and President of StarMedia. Alejandro holds a BA and CPA degrees from Universidad Católica Argentina. He is a thought leader in the fintech industry and well-respected in the financial and entrepreneurship sectors in Latin America. He is a thoughtful, execution-oriented, and transparent leader and manager.<br><br></p>

     <h6>Elevar's Take</h6>
						<p><i>Scalable, client oriented company that has the potential of impacting the lives of millions through a disruptive and innovative fintech model</i><br><br>

Afluenta is Elevar’s third investment from Elevar Equity III in Latin America and follows the fund’s thesis of addressing underserved communities through viable and scalable business models. The availability of data between individuals and financial services providers and the transaction ease offered by modern technology presents great opportunity for innovation to meet the needs of many consumers, underserved otherwise, with high-quality financial services. Afluenta is a unique opportunity for Elevar to back a disruptive business led by strong founding team with a unique combination of financial services, internet/technology and entrepreneurship. Afluenta offers a disruptive model that promotes financial inclusion with greater customer focus for borrowers both within and outside the financial system. For those with access to banking products, Afluenta offers greater convenience, transparency and customer care at similar prices – hence better customer value. For those who don’t have access to bank credit, Afluenta offers financial access and lower cost loans than non-bank financial or payday loan companies.
