						<h2>Financing low-income housing and micro and small enterprises in tier two and tier three cities in Peru</h2><br>
						
                        <h6><br>Company Overview</h6>
						<p>Financiera TFC is a regulated financial institution focused primarily on financing low-income housing and micro and small enterprises in second and third-tier cities in Peru. The company partners, works with, and finances experienced and high-quality developers of low-income housing projects, and offers mortgage products to low-income families acquiring their first home in these communities. As a secondary focus, the company serves Micro and Small Enterprises via working capital, asset, and productive chain financing. TFC seeks to be a fully diversified financial institution, which includes savings accounts and other financial services (deposits, medium enterprise financing, guarantee letters, transfers, etc).</p>

						
						<h6>Community Served</h6><br>
						<p><i>Low and Low-middle-income clients from tier two and tier three cities in Peru</i></p>
                        <p>TFC focuses on underserved markets with low penetration by the mainstream financial sector. Low-income housing in Peru’s provinces represents such an opportunity. Within this segment, it is estimated that the housing deficit is close to 1.9 Mn units, of which 1.3 Mn are needed outside of Lima. About 75% of this deficit refers to a quality deficit, or the need to replace housing units that are overcrowded, were constructed with improper materials, or lack basic conditions (i.e. running water, sewage, electricity, etc.).<br><br>
TFC serves its target customers from low and middle-income communities from tier two and tier three cities in Peru. About two-thirds or 30 million Peruvians live outside the Lima region, making up a large percentage of the low-income housing market. In addition TFC serves small businesses, located in Peru’s provinces. Historically, these MSME’s have not had the opportunity to acquire financial products from traditional banks due to factors such as poor credit history.<br><br> 
To address these needs, TFC has established a client-centric organization that truly embraces the idea of developing solutions for their clients’ needs, offering affordable, tailored financial products with long repayment periods.</p>
						
						<h6>Business Model</h6>
						<p><i>Differentiated business model, focused on unit economics, thoughtful product structuring and key partnerships</i></p><br>
                        
                        TFC’s approach to low-income housing and MSMEs is grounded in collaboration with key institutions around the country. For low-income housing projects, the company works with and finances experienced and high-quality developers, and offers mortgage products to low-income families acquiring their first home. For the MSME market, TFC seeks to augment its reach by partnering with groups of MSMEs (e.g. market cooperatives or productive chain aggregators) to create an operationally efficient base of clients. Once a strong base is created, the company opens a branch to serve its clients and grow its base in the market. 
In addition to an organic growth strategy, the company is engaging in targeted M&A activity, leveraging the current push by the Peruvian banking regulator for consolidation of the market around strong financial institutions. 
<br><br>
                        
                        <h6>Entrepreneurs and Team</h6>
						<p><i>30+ years of experience in the banking sector</i><br><br>

Andres Muñoz, Chairman of the Board, is recognized as one of the best bankers in Peru, with impressive strategic vision, superb structuring capabilities, and deep execution skills. He started his 30-year career in Banco Santander and later moved to Interbank where he played a key role in turning it into one of the largest banks in Peru. His vision anchors on innovation and entering new, underpenetrated markets, pioneering products in middle and low-income housing and agri-finance businesses which have become priorities for government development but have been underserved by the existing Peruvian financial system. Andres has focused on developing the company and building an organizational culture with entrepreneurial spirit, customer alignment, and drive. At senior level TFC has a strong  team, with proven experience in credit risk analysis, corporate and SME banking, operational control, financial and strategic planning. Recently Luis Mella was designated as CEO - Luis contributes over 25+ years of commercial banking experience and particular Province management and commercial expertise.

     <h6>Elevar's Take</h6>
						<p><i>Scalable client-centric business model in a large market that has the potential of impacting an underserved market in Peru
</i><br><br>

TFC is Elevar’s second investment from Elevar Equity III in Latin America and follows the fund’s thesis of addressing underserved communities through viable business models. Despite its size, TFC has the entrepreneurial spirit and innovative, customer focused culture of a much smaller organization. Andres and his team have managed to create a client-centric business model that truly embraces the idea of developing solutions for their client needs.<br><br>
We believe that TFC is the best-positioned financial institution to address the financing needs of low-income housing segment in Peru, as well as other financing needs in second and third tier cities - a large, underbanked market that traditional players have failed to serve adequately due to lack of appropriate team, size, and expertise.
