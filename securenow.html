						<h2>Distribution of general insurance products to SMEs through a technology enabled proposition</h2><br>
						
                        <h6><br>Company Overview</h6>
						<p>SecureNow, founded by Kapil Mehta and Abhishek Bondia is an insurance broking company focused on providing general insurance for Indian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Currently the general insurance penetration in India is significantly low in this segment, indicating high market potential. SecureNow’s unique customer proposition hinges on the founding team’s deep passion for the underlying SME customer segment coupled with the strong relationships built with the insurance companies. Their ability to address the typical pain points of the customer is evident in the thoughtful approach of execution. 
The typical general insurance products they provide include group health insurance, workmen’s compensation, motor insurance, liability insurance and personal accident insurance. More importantly, SecureNow helps negotiate terms on behalf of SMEs with the insurance companies and gives them a bargaining power similar to what large corporate clients have. Kapil Mehta brings over two decades of experience in insurance, operations and consulting. Abhishek Bondia brings in-depth experience in the insurance space having worked extensively in consulting with global insurance companies.  
Elevar Equity III led the Series A investment into the company in February 2016.</p>

						
						<h6>Community Served</h6><br>
						<p><i>SMEs lacking access to general insurance due to absence of institutionalized insurance brokers catering to SMEs
</i></p>
                        <p>SecureNow caters to Indian SMEs that are highly under-insured. SMEs lack access to organized institutional brokers and are served by a fairly fragmented and unorganized market of individual insurance brokers and agents. These agents do not have adequate understanding of general insurance products and lack any negotiation power vis-a-vis insurance companies. They also do not have any technology or  systems support to be able to offer ongoing services to their clients. This results in poor quality services and response rates. </p>
						
						<h6>Business Model</h6>
						<p><i>Distribution of general insurance products through a combination of offline acquisition and online fulfilment</i></p><br>
                        
                        SecureNow’s business model is uniquely placed to adapt and cater to a complex product and a customer who requires intense engagement. Their business proposition derives strength from the relationships maintained by offline ‘partners’ who are traditional advisors or service providers to SMEs in various capacities, and also draw from the pace and non-linearity of web-aggregators. They are far more relationship oriented compared to transactional web-aggregators who simply issue over-the-counter products, but have a strong tech enabled proposition that allows them to drive efficiencies and aggregate SME demand nationally. Lead generation is done through three channels- online, partnerships (online or offline) and through referrals. Technology plays a key role in servicing each of the stakeholders through the process of acquisition, fulfilment and end-customer servicing which helps minimise their operational expenses.<br><br>
                        
                        <h6>Entrepreneurs and Team</h6>
						<p><i>The founders - Kapil Mehta and Abhishek Bondia have over 30 years of combined experience in the context of retail distribution and specific expertise in the insurance sector</i><br><br>

The key founder of SecureNow is Kapil. He incorporated the Company in February 2011 with an initial capital of $0.9 MN (INR60 MN). He brings in over eight years of experience in the insurance business and over a decade’s experience in operations and consulting.  Prior to founding SecureNow, he was the CEO of DLF Pramerica Life Insurance. He also worked with Max Life Insurance Company as the Senior Vice President, Business Development & Strategic Planning. Early on in his career, he worked with McKinsey & Co. as a consultant and with Hindustan Unilever Limited as a Product Manager. Kapil’s educational qualifications include an MBA from IIM-Ahmedabad and an Engineering degree from IIT-Delhi.<br><br>
Kapil was introduced to Abhishek Bondia during the initial days at SecureNow and he joined Kapil as co-founder. Abhishek was working with the offshore arm of McKinsey & Co. At McKinsey, Abhishek worked extensively in the non-life and health insurance markets in the US and India - building expertise in multiple insurance products, giving him a holistic perspective on client servicing. He has contributed to knowledge and thought leadership at McKinsey, where he published various proprietary knowledge documents on healthcare and insurance.<br><br></p>

     <h6>Elevar's Take</h6>
						<p><i>A thoughtfully constructed, scalable business model which has the potential to transform distribution of general insurance products to SMEs that lack access to quality risk management products critical for their businesses</i><br><br>

SecureNow is the first entrepreneurial effort in India at setting up an SME focused broking entity. They are uniquely positioned to lead the market in terms of catering to this segment. Large insurance brokers do not have the DNA or inclination, given small ticket sizes, to be able to pursue the SME segment which requires a quasi ‘retail’ distribution culture. Further, the individual brokers and agents lack the sophistication and infrastructure to provide a robust proposition to the small businesses.<br><br>
The combination of the promoters’ experience, execution abilities, passion for the SME segment, market reputation built thus far and in-depth understanding of the nuances of insurance products make this a compelling investment proposition for Elevar. The entrepreneurs share Elevar’s ambition for scale and providing the SMEs the bargaining power and choice that has traditionally belonged only to large corporates in the country. This has the potential to fundamentally transform the way insurance has been distributed in India.
