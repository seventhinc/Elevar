						<h2>Data-driven, digital financial services marketplace for borrowers disadvantaged due to negative or no credit history</h2><br>
						
                        <h6><br>Company Overview</h6>
						<p>CreditMantri, co-founded by Ranjit Punja, R Sudarshan, and Gowri Mukerjee, has built a data-driven, financial services marketplace on a digital platform for borrowers with varying credit profiles, primarily focussed on those with negative or no credit history.<br><br> 
Through its core proposition of educating and supporting the customer to help create / improve credit scores they  provide access to appropriate credit products.  CreditMantri has the ability to change the lives of their  customers by facilitating access to a diversified set of financial services products linked to the lifecycle of the customer. This long term, personalized engagement with a segment that lacks access to credit products provides a unique opportunity to build customer loyalty and provide true value to the end customer.<br><br>
The founders - Ranjit Punja (CEO), R Sudarshan (COO) and Gowri Mukherjee (CMO), bring significant experience and have over 60 years of combined experience in the banking and credit space – particularly in consumer lending, collections, technology, outsourcing and digital marketing. They have held senior positions with leading financial institutions such as Citibank and Standard Chartered Bank in India and the USA.<br><br>
Elevar’s Fund III co-led the Series A Round with IDG Ventures, and an investment from Accion Venture Labs. </p>

						
						<h6>Community Served</h6><br>
						<p><i>Customers lacking access to credit through regular banking channels because of negative or no credit history</i></p>
                        <p>CreditMantri is primarily focused on customers who are unable to access credit products through regular banking channels because of negative or no credit history. The negative credit history often arises out of a lack of financial understanding regarding the importance and implications of building and maintaining a good credit score - and CreditMantri is not only creating awareness about the importance of credit score, but also educating the customers on how to improve their credit scores and provide access to relevant products. There is also a large segment of customers who are entering the workforce in semi-formal or low level positions who do not have any credit history and are excluded from the financial system. Both these segments have the necessary purchasing power and represent a large untapped opportunity for the financial services industry.</p>
						
						<h6>Business Model</h6>
						<p><i>Integrates data and credit scoring with online lending, assessing creditworthiness and working with customers to improve credit history</i></p><br>Credit scores play an important role in financial inclusion. The process is expected to become more inclusive with credit-scoring models factoring in multiple surrogates like online and mobile usage data, alternate KYC validations through social media and other channels – making it easier for financial institutions to evaluate a potential customer’s credit risk. CreditMantri aims to create a digital marketplace that primarily comprises the “left” (customers in need of credit related services) and the “right” (financial institutions that are providers of credit products). The platform brings together both sides with value added services focused on credit scores, i.e. taking a comprehensive view of the creditworthiness of a customer and providing information to lenders to enable more nuanced credit decisions. CreditMantri’s revenue streams initially flow from the left (consulting income from borrowers seeking assistance) and eventually move to the right (commissions from financial institutions that now have access to a large lendable borrower base) as they build up volumes. 
<br><br>
                        
                        <h6>Entrepreneurs and Team</h6>
						<p><i>The founders - Ranjit Punja (CEO), R Sudarshan (COO) and Gowri Mukherjee (CMO), have over 60 years of combined experience in the banking and credit space</i><br><br>

Ranjit Punja, co-founder and CEO has over 23 years of experience with Citibank, where he led the collections function for all international consumer lending businesses covering 10,000 people in 53 countries and independently managed the receivables collection for a US based $25 BN credit card portfolio, with risk responsibility for approximately $1 BN. He started CreditMantri in March 2012 along with his co-founder, R. Sudarshan. Ranjit oversees credit, and will be responsible for key relationships and corporate strategy.<br><br>
R Sudarshan, co-founder and COO, has over 20 years of experience in banking operations and technology (Citibank, TCS) covering areas of credit, collections, finance and control. He was part of the leadership team that set up Citibank’s captive BPO, eServe International, which started with 25 employees and grew to over 12,000 employees by 2008. At CreditMantri, Sudarshan oversees finance, operations and corporate administration.<br><br>
Gowri Mukherjee, co-Founder and CMO, has over 17 years of experience in banking at Citibank, Standard Chartered and HSBC, of which 14 years have been in the digital space covering new product development, marketing, eCommerce and mobile payments. Prior to joining CreditMantri, she was at Standard Chartered Bank as the Global Head of Digital Marketing, where she created and executed a cohesive digital strategy to deliver the bank’s brand, customer and commercial aspirations across geographies. Gowri joined the CreditMantri team in Nov 2014 as a co-founder and oversees marketing and customer experience. 
</p>

     <h6>Elevar's Take</h6>
						<p><i>A highly scalable business model that focuses on leveraging data and credit scoring in the online lending space to bring about increased credit underwriting transparency and provide borrowers in this segment with control of their own credit history</i><br><br>

CreditMantri is Elevar’s first technology enabled investment focused on building a data driven online lending marketplace to enhance financial inclusion. It is India’s first large scale attempt at bringing about increased credit underwriting transparency and providing borrowers in lower income segments with control of their own credit history through a concerted customer focused proposition – one that educates and hand-holds the customer to help create / improve credit scores and provides access to appropriate credit products.<br><br>
If executed well, CreditMantri will significantly enhance the levels of transparency in credit underwriting, and in the process, inculcate an inclusive credit environment across a range of financial services players. The founding team has both the maturity and experience, as well as the enthusiasm to address this gap using a digital medium that is fast picking up across the users (borrowers and lenders). This positions CreditMantri well to be able to scale in an exponential manner over time. <br>
